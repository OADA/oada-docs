## Questions
For contributors to the OADA project, the best method for contact is the
[oada-dev][oada-dev] mailing list on Google Groups.  For those just getting
started, the [oada-users][oada-users] mailing list on Google Groups is a good
place to ask questions.

We also now have a Gitter channel to chat (see the badge at the top of this readme).
