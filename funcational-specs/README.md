# OADA Functional Specifications

OADA Ecosystem has been designed to provide the farmer with best possible
experience in securely storing and sharing their data with entities of farmer's
choice. Following concepts form the foundation of this Ecosystem:

 1. Farmer should be able to use ANY OADA compliant cloud(s) as a storage system
    of choice.
 2. Farmer should be able to grant / revoke access to his / her OADA cloud or
    specific files inside of his / her OADA cloud to other entities in OADA
    Ecosystem.
 3. Framer should be able to seamlessly transfer data across OADA compliant
    clouds.

In order to realize the concepts described above, the Ecosystem defines a set of
entities that have well specified relationships and behavior.

To accomplish this, we will define the types of users who may use some part of
OADA, characteristic example usage scenarios that describe details of how they
may use the OADA ecosystem in daily life to accomplish tasks, and a high level
overview of the basic components of the OADA ecosystem
